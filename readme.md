This repository contains CAD files for the external shell (surface topology) of Steam Deck, under a Creative Commons license. This includes an STP model, STL model, and drawings (DWG) for reference.

We're looking forward to seeing what the community creates! Please reach out to us at SteamDeckExternal@valvesoftware.com with any questions, feedback, requests, and most importantly – interesting creations.

As mentioned in our “[Take a look inside Steam Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs)” video, you have every right to open up your Steam Deck and do what you want with it. That said, we highly recommend you leave it to professionals. Any damage you do will not be covered by your warranty –  but more importantly, you might break your Steam Deck, or even get hurt! Be careful, and have fun.
